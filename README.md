# AnimalFarm
This program written in java demonstrates an animal farm mannagement app.
This very basic program let the user remove/add new annimal and save the list to a DB
It was written for learnning purpuse.


I used java SWING user interface build in java.
java swing library had pure java graphic objects like: Jbutton,Jtable,jlabel etc.
it helps creating a system user interface, using the system graphic GUI.
the of the program:
  1. Creating objects
  2. Arranging the objects with the help of layout mannager
  3. listen and response for the objects events: Events driven programming
  
  The program uses MVC,MVVM  patterns.
  The GUI is complately seperated from the Model, so it is possible to write any other UI with no effect of the program.
  Install - simply run the code as pure java application, in your prefered IDE.
